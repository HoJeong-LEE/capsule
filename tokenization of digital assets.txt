In our contract each token generated represents one license to use the software. 
Whoever holds that token is licensed to run the software. 

If the token is transferred, so is the access to the software.


The licenses will expire after some time and they will have to be topped up to remain valid. 
For that we are going to create an additional mapping between licenses and expiration dates. 
We will have one method that accepts Ether and pushes the expiration date of the licenses into the future.

After that we only need one more method to check expiration dates which is very simple.
